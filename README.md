# Star Citizen File Downloader
Launcher file processing based on [original VB.NET downloader](https://bitbucket.org/nimmog/scpatchdownloader-vb.net/overview) by NimmoG

Downloadable binaries are available in [releases](https://github.com/Hawxy/SCAlternativePatcher/releases)

The GUI is pretty straight forward, but if you get confused, see [INSTRUCTIONS.txt](https://github.com/Hawxy/SCAlternativeDownloader/blob/master/SCPatchDownloader/INSTRUCTIONS.txt)

Differences from original VB.NET downloader:

- Option to maintain the normal SC file structure
- Directory saving on exit
- Download speed/file indicator
- Proper file dialog
- Works behind proxy
- General code structure changes
- Material design
- Other random stuff

Platform:
- Requires Windows 7 SP1 or newer
- 64-bit only

Contributions are welcome:
- .NET 4.6.2 | C# 7.0 | Visual Studio 2017 
- Please run any major modifications by me first on the ZephyrDev server: https://discord.gg/Mjb8Pda
- To use the material library, drag the MaterialSkin.dll in the "ref" folder to your toolbox

This is a personal project of mine so you'll probably see some pointless overengineering
