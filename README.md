# Star Citizen Downloader with GUI

Downloadable binaries are available in [releases](https://github.com/Hawxy/SCAlternativePatcher/releases)

The GUI is pretty straight forward, but if you get confused, see [INSTRUCTIONS.txt](https://github.com/Hawxy/SCAlternativeDownloader/blob/master/SCPatchDownloader/INSTRUCTIONS.txt)

Core features:

- Option to maintain the normal SC file structure or save by game version
- Option to use a custom build file from old versions of SC
- Directory saving on exit
- Download speed/file indicator
- Works behind proxy server
- Material design
- Other random stuff

Platform:
- Requires Windows 7 SP1 or newer
- 64-bit only

Contributions are welcome:
- .NET 4.7 | WPF MVVM | C# 7.1 | Visual Studio 2017 (v15.3)
- Please run any major modifications by me first on the ZephyrDev server: https://discord.gg/Mjb8Pda

This is a personal project of mine so you'll probably see some pointless overengineering
