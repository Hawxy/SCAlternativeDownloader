1. Extract the .exe somewhere and run it.

2. The dropdown at the top should default to "Public", and unless you wish to download a PTU/Evocati version of SC, just leave it as default and press Select Release.

3. Select a folder to download the game to. *DO NOT USE A PRE-EXISTING STAR CITIZEN DIRECTORY, THIS IS A DOWNLOADER, NOT A PATCHER*

4. Unless you intend to archive SC releases by build number, keep Preserve Native File Structure enabled. 

5. Download.

6. Once done, your file structure will look something like [DownloadFolder]/StarCitizen/Public, copy the StarCitizen folder into the Cloud Imperium Games directory (C:\Program Files\Cloud Imperium Games by default).

7. Sign into the launcher as usual and you should be ready to play
